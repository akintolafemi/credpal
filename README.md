# CredPal Wallet Operations Project

This project is built using NestJS, TypeORM, MySQL, Redis for caching, and BullMQ for queuing wallet operations.

## Technologies Used

- **NestJS:** A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications.
- **TypeORM:** An ORM that can run in NodeJS and browser and can be used with TypeScript and JavaScript (ES5/ES6/ES7/ES8).
- **MySQL:** A widely used open-source relational database management system.
- **Redis:** An open-source, in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache and message broker.
- **BullMQ:** A robust queue system for Node.js backed by Redis.
- **Swagger:** For API documentation.

## Setup Instructions

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1.  **Create MySQL Database:**

    - Create a MySQL database named `credpal_db`.

2.  **Configure Environment Variables:**

    - Copy the `env.sample` file to youur `.env` in the root directory of the project.
    - Update the `.env` file with your specific configurations, including:
      - MySQL database connection details.
      - Redis connection details.
      - Any other required environment variables.

3.  **Install Redis:**

    - Install and configure a Redis server on your local machine or server.

4.  **Get Exchange Rate API Key:**

    - Create an account on [https://www.exchangerate-api.com/](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/) to obtain an API key.
    - Add the API key to your `.env` file.

5.  **Documentation:**

    - Api documentation is available at [http://localhost:${PORT}/documentation] when project is started

6.  **Token:**

    - A default token is required to access all endpoints in the /auth route
    - For other routes, the session token generated at login is required to access every other endpoints

7.  **JWT**
    - Create a certs folder in the root directory and generate private and public pem files under the names jwt.private.pem and jwt.public.pem.

## Running the Project

To run the project install npm modules:

```bash
npm install
```

```

# credpal

## Assumptions

1. **First Wallet Balance (NGN wallet)**
   -There is an assumption that when a user is signing up, the user adds their debit card and a sum of 50,000.00NGN is debited and credited to the first generated NGN wallet

# üß≠ User Flow

## üìù Registration

- User registers with **email** and **password**.

## üîê OTP Verification

- An OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to the user's email address.
- User verifies their account using the OTP.
- If a new OTP is needed, it can be requested via the `/auth/request/otp` endpoint.

## üîì Login

- User logs in with **email** and **password**.
- Upon successful login:
  - A **token** (valid for 60 minutes) is generated.
  - A **refresh token** (valid for 70 minutes) is also generated.
- The **access token** must be used as a bearer token for authentication in all subsequent API requests.

## üíº Initial Wallet Creation

- Once the account is verified:
  - An **NGN (Nigerian Naira)** wallet is automatically created for the user.
  - The wallet is credited with an initial balance of **‚Ç¶50,000.00**.

## üí± Additional Wallets

- Users can generate wallets for other **currency types**.
- Users are restricted to **only one wallet per currency type**.

## üí≥ Wallet Operations

- Users can perform the following wallet operations via API:
  - **Funding**
  - **Transfers**
  - **Balance checks**
- All operations require a **valid bearer token** for authentication.
